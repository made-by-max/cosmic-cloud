I originally purchased the course during the pre-release period about 4 years ago, but never got around to working on it (that's a pretty common theme).

After doing his [Whimsical Animations](https://whimsy.joshwcomeau.com/) course earlier this fall I was finally inspired to go back and work on the CSS one. It's actually probably a good thing I didn't do it until now because it required a decent amount of React knowledge that I definitely didn't have when I first bought it.

Overall I thought it was a really great course. A lot of it was theoretically things I already knew, but Josh goes into such incredible depth on all the topics that I learned a ton! Highly recommended.

Working on both courses was starting to make me wish I'd signed up for his [Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/) course at the pre-release price when it first came out. I couldn't quite justify paying full price for it with all the other courses I've bought lately, but wouldn't you know it - he has a Black Friday sale going on now. So...yeah. I'm doing Joy of React now.
