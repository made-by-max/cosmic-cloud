With the exception of my trip to Japan last week, I've been doing some sort of coding pretty much every day for the past few months. But I haven't been very good about sharing what I've been doing, despite my best intentions about the whole 'learning in public' thing.

So I've decided to give 100 days of code another whirl (I did it once before about 6 years ago), not so much to keep myself accountable for coding, but more to keep myself accountable for sharing what I'm working on.

I'll be posting my updates over on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/madebymax.bsky.social) if you want to follow along.
