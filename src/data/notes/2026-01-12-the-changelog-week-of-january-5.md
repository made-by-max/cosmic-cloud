## Week of Jan 5

### One good thing that happened this week

I went a little off the rails with the holiday eating this year, but I’ve been getting back into the swing of things and my pants are starting to be comfortable again.

### Best things I’ve read/watched/consumed this week

[Why RSS matters](https://werd.io/why-rss-matters/)

I've really been enjoying all the conversation about RSS lately. I think that, at least in some circles, people are starting to see the need for open standards and escaping the algorithmic feed. I doubt RSS is ever really going to hit the mainstream, but I hope we're seeing the return of the indieweb in at least some small corners of the web.

[Pivoting Your Career Without Starting From Scratch](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2026/01/pivoting-career-without-starting-from-scratch/)

This was more about developers moving out of development, which is the opposite of what I'm trying to do, but there was still some pertinent information, and a good reminder that pivoting your career doesn't mean starting over completely.

[2025](https://thomaswc.com/2025.html)

Like Connections on steroids. This game is completely addictive. I've been slowly chipping away at it throughout the week.

### What I’ve been learning/doing this week

After finishing The Joy of React I haven’t really settled on what to do next, plus work and life both got kinda busy, so I didn’t do as much I’d hoped this week. I played with Motion a bit and messed around with a couple of personal projects, but that’s about it.
