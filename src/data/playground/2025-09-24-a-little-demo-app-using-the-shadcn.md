I was really hoping to finish up [Scrimba's Advanced React Course](https://scrimba.com/advanced-react-c02h) today (I'm soooo close), but I ended up building [a little demo](https://timely-buttercream-545448.netlify.app/) instead.

One of my coworkers is working on a way to display a large amount of information in a dropdown menu, and I suggested using a command palette. Then I used Shadcn's command and combobox components to build out a super simple demo to illustrate what I was thinking.

This is actually the first time I've used a component library in React. It was fairly painless and surprisingly fun. I definitely need to start building more projects instead of just working through courses and tutorials.
