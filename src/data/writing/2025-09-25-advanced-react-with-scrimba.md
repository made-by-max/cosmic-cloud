Today I wrapped up [Scrimba's Advanced React Course](https://scrimba.com/advanced-react-c02h), which means I'm basically done with their [Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j) (aside from the Getting Hired module). I've been working on the career path on and off for about two years, so it feels incredible to finally be wrapping it up. I actually made it through the Advanced React course in just two weeks thanks in large part to finally getting properly medicated for my ADHD. Next up, I want to deep dive on CSS and animations.

## Animations

Josh Comeau's [Whimsical Animations](https://whimsy.joshwcomeau.com/) course just dropped yesterday, so I'm excited to jump into that. I also want to learn more about [CSS scroll driven animations](https://scroll-driven-animations.style/), [GSAP](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://gsap.com/&ved=2ahUKEwjdjdvz4_SPAxWaIjQIHSveIiMQFnoECAwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1y2vodGHQw_FyXtEgLCWE8), and [Motion](https://motion.dev/).

## CSS

As far as CSS is concerned, I have a pretty decent handle on the fundamentals, but I can definitely stand to go deeper on a lot of things. Plus, there's been so many new features released in the past few years that there's a lot to catch up on.

There's a lot there, to be sure, and it's very tempting to bounce around and try to learn everything all at once. I'm trying to keep that a little more under control, which is a big part of why I pushed so hard at the finish line of the frontend career path - so I could actually wrap that up before moving on to the next thing.

Onwards!
