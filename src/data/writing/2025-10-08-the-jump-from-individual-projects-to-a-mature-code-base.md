I set up a local dev environment of my company's design system and I've been playing around with it a bit the past few days. Even though I've worked through a couple of React courses it's mostly been building small projects from scratch. Jumping into an existing design system and a mature code base has a bit of a learning curve, but I'm gradually figuring it out. It's really cool to be able to pull in components we use in our design system and actually piece them together into a live website.
