      I'm a product designer, former librarian, and (hopefully) future design
      engineer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started my career as a librarian (which means I'm awesome at information
      architecture) before making a career pivot and getting into UX about 9
      years ago. Lately I've been thinking about making another (smaller) career
      change and getting into design engineering. I'm currently teaching myself
      React and a couple of animation libraries, while also brushing up on my
      CSS and JavaScript. I'll probably throw a little express.js and node.js in
      the mix to cover a bit of the backend as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a product designer, my specialties are informatin architecture, systems
      thinking, accessibility and inclusive design. I spent 7 years working on
      developer tools and I'm currently working in the healthcare space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work I enjoy powerlifting, reading, hiking, and hanging out
      with my faithful canine companion, Rufus.
